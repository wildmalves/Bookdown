# Project Organization

For my final semester project, I will be establishing a database that will enable me to manage, clean, and code my incoming data for eventual import into R for meta-analysis. The Google Forms Survey was lauched two weeks ago. So far, I have received 22 responses. I will use this as test data and manipulate it to fit my database structure.

## Load Raw Data from Survey

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(readxl)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE}
RawData_test <- readxl::read_excel ("~/MASTERS/Bookdown/GoogleFormRespTEST.xlsx")
RawData_test
```
