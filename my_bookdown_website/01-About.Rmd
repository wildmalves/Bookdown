# Project Organization

For my final semester project, I will be establishing a database that will enable me to manage, clean, and code my incoming data for eventual import into R for meta-analysis. The Google Forms Survey was launched ~two weeks ago. So far, I have received 22 responses. I will use this as test data and manipulate it to fit my database structure.
