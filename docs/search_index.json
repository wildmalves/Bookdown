Their systematic removal led to a loss of wetland habitat and ecosystem services provided by the beaver’s damming activity. Modern harvest restrictions have enabled their recovery in some areas; however, there are many barriers to natural recolonization, whether anthropogenic (infrastructure, stream channelization), ecological (climate impacts to seasonal flow and vegetative communities), or political (misclassification and social carrying capacity). Today, beaver translocation has become a popular management strategy for habitat restoration, fire abatement, and a widely accepted method of nature-based restoration in rewilding efforts. There are, however, vast differences in the ways in which beaver translocation programs monitor translocated beavers in terms of release site selection and post-translocation monitoring, how they define translocation success, and the policies that guide translocation activities. My thesis aims to synthesize available information by (1) accumulating and analyzing beaver translocation methodology data from current and past translocations; and (2) developing a database of existing beaver management policies where beaver translocation is occurring. By analyzing the cumulative data from all contributing beaver translocation projects, I propose to create guiding principles for humane and successful beaver translocation. Combining this synthesis, with an accessible database on policies, will allow future translocation projects to rapidly identify best practices for their geographic region.

The Google Forms Survey was lauched two weeks ago. So far, I have received 22 responses. I will use this as test data and manipulate it to fit my database structure. 2.1 Load Raw Data from Survey RawData_test &lt;- readxl::read_excel (&quot;~/MASTERS/Bookdown/GoogleFormRespTEST.xlsx&quot;) RawData_test ## # A tibble: 22 × 110 ## Timestamp Email A…¹ What …² What …³ What …⁴ If no…⁵ What …⁶ What …⁷ ## &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 2023-03-28 07:39:33 travis.c… Travis… Habita… State/… NA WY Gam… NA ## 2 2022-11-29 10:12:27 jerry.al… Gerard… Biolog… State n/a Wyomin… &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 2023-03-24 14:14:43 dcollins… Dylan … Assist… Tribal &lt;NA&gt; The Tu… Tulali… ## 4 2023-03-28 08:33:57 charnna@… Charnn… Execut… Non-pr… 501c3 Scott … N/A ## 5 2023-03-28 08:40:16 rschicks… Rachel… Presid… Non-pr… fiscal… Illino… n/a ## 6 2023-03-28 09:42:33 matt.pro… Matt P… Region… State/… &lt;NA&gt; Idaho … Upper … ## 7 2023-03-28 11:44:46 loren.ta… Loren … Wildli… Part-t… &lt;NA&gt; Beaver… NA ## 8 2023-03-28 15:55:18 caristuc… Caroli… Gradua… UC Dav… &lt;NA&gt; UC Dav… NA ## 9 2023-03-29 08:51:16 sahill@u… Shane … Habita… State/… &lt;NA&gt; Utah D… Northe… ## 10 2023-03-29 10:29:14 teresagr… Teresa… Wildli… State/… &lt;NA&gt; Utah D… Southe… ## # … with 12 more rows, 102 more variables: ## # `Are you the project lead for the beaver translocations?` &lt;chr&gt;, ## # `If no, or co-lead, who is the project lead/co-lead?` &lt;chr&gt;, ## # `Where is your project located (ex: name of City, County, State, Province, Country, Watershed, etc...)?` &lt;chr&gt;, ## # `Does your project employ seasonal or permanent staff (check all that apply)?` &lt;chr&gt;, ## # `What is the population status of beavers in your area?` &lt;chr&gt;, ## # `Does your jurisdiction allow for the translocation of beavers?` &lt;chr&gt;, … "],["database-structure.html", "Chapter 3 Database Structure 3.1 Database Creation 3.2 Tables 3.3 Relational Database Diagram", " Chapter 3 Database Structure The package DBI was used to create the database and tables. I chose this directory structure so that it is nested in my root directory for easy import into R and for version tracking with Git. For organizational purposes, I placed it in my MASTERS folder, under the folder MetaAnalysis so that all files associated with my degree and proposed meta-analysis are in one, easy to locate folder. I chose to add folders for Code, Data, Figures, Manuscripts, README, and Results at your recommendation so that I can track and version control all incoming data, code that is created, and eventual Figures, Results, and Manuscripts that are developed from the eventual analysis. The README folder will track all inputs to these folders as my metadata. The MetaAnalysis folder can then be zipped and shared at the conclusion of the study for anyone that may want to replicate my methods. 3.1 Database Creation metabeaver_db &lt;- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), &quot;../../MASTERS/MetaAnalysis/Data/metabeaver.db&quot;) 3.2 Tables responses, projects, questions, answers_text, answers_mc, answers_ls, answers_ca. 3.2.1 responses - This table will contain all responses submitted to the Google Forms survey and will contact columns for response ID (resp_id) and project ID (proj_id).
